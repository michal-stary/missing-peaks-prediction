## Description
Compound identification is essential for monitoring the environment. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) is a widely used method for such identification. A crucial step in the processing of complex data coming from the physical GC-MS instrument is peak detection. The errors of peak detection algorithms, such as missed peaks, severely limit the researchers' ability to monitor low-concentration toxins and pollutants. We proposed and developed an approach to predict the missing peaks with the Machine Learning (ML) methods leveraging the spectral databases. We experimented with multiple ML models based on kNN and neural networks. We observed that the attention-based transformer model is the most suitable for the prediction of peaks missed due to noise. Furthermore, the multi-layer perceptron turned out to be superior in predicting peaks missed because of imperfect chromatographic separation. These models have been quantitatively and qualitatively shown to predict multiple correct peaks for both known and unknown compounds. Moreover, we identified which kinds of peaks are less and more challenging to predict. The results illustrate the feasibility of ML methods trained on spectral databases to improve peak detection and establish the ground for future research
